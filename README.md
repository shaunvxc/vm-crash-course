# Thiago's VM crash course


## Goal

This course should guide lost souls into constructing a stack based virtual
machine and all the pains that go into building one, following the smalltalk
and lisp tradition. Expect old and modern techniques to make appearences.

## Before start

- This is a very terse course (aimed at professional programmers)
- Each exercise was designed to be completed in `< 1 hour`.
- The first exercises of each chapter may require some infra-structures so may
  take a little longer.
- Your medium must to be a system programming language like C -- there's no
  point in trying to learn how things work under the hood if one is always
  over the hood (the exception is the warm up exercise #1 where a highlevel
  language is permitted to be used).
- Compiler writing skills will make your life easier, but these texts won't
  talk about parsing nor about code generation.
